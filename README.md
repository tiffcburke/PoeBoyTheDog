# PoeBoyTheDog

Visit the website this code created: **https://tiffcburke.github.io/PoeBoyTheDog/**

Languages Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP

This is the first HTML/CSS project where I created a static website. I originally had some backend code that included an email contact page, however I decided not to include
this into the website since Github only allows static pages. The PHP code is still availible in my repository. 

If you have any suggestions on how this website could improve, please reach out! I would love any advice that could assist in my coding journey.
